* Ultra quick summary of the meetup.

The meetup was organized in [[http://www.sfeir.com/][Sfeir]]'s offices in Paris.

** Who were there?

Everyone quickly introduced himself.

Participants:
- A majority of developers from the JVM world
- Someone in the field of astrophysics
- A C++ developer
- ...

** What was the topic of the meetup?

Purpose of the meetup: Explore the webFUI framework.
- It's a framework on top of [[https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript#what-is-clojurescript][Clojurescript]].
- Aims at: Purely functional programming in the browser.
- Essentially: *The DOM as data (tm)*.

*** Clojure and the Web Intro: Clojure + Compojure + Hiccup

Before diving into the Ajaxy world, a small "traditional" web "1.0" app
was presented, with the same architecture as [[https://github.com/ardumont/geekteek][this application]].

*** [[https://github.com/drcode/webfui][webFUI]] introduction

The presentation looked like the one [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHeI5-D7SQe8][by the author at ClojureConj 2012]].

For those interested by the framework, the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQn_saQurqgvxHiyuOZ7twK4K_w_VftBHrPKJolwEZ8/edit][design document of webFUI]] is
highly recommended:
- It explains the constraints that led to the design decisions of the
  framework.
- And all code examples are derived from this doc.

*** No code was written ...

... yet ! :wink:

** Emacs

For some, discovering Clojure also led to (re)discovering Emacs, and
[[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

Here an example of (everything?) that you can do with it [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][that you can do
with it]].
